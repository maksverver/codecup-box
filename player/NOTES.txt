GAME NOTES

Game states have between 100 and 200 possible tile placements per turn, except
close to the beginning or end of the game. More than 260 seems rare in practice.
(Theoretical upper limit?)

Number of turns per game seems closely centered around 30 including the first
neutral placement, so about 15 turns per player:

  turns percent
     26 3
     27 8
     28 23
     29 21
     30 21
     31 15
     32 7
     33 2

TODO: compare this with competition results.

My current player is quite good at spoiling the opponent's squares, keeping
scores very low for both players.
