GAME NOTES

Game states have between 100 and 200 possible tile placements per turn, except
close to the beginning or end of the game. More than 260 seems rare in practice.

An upper bound is (16-2+1)*(20-6+1) + (16-6+1)*(20-2+1) == 434 based on grid
coordinates. (Actual upper limit?)

Number of turns per game seems closely centered around 30 including the first
neutral placement, so about 15 turns per player:

  turns percent
     26 3
     27 8
     28 23
     29 21
     30 21
     31 15
     32 7
     33 2

Theoretical upper limit: 39 turns, including the starting turn, so 19 per
player. Logic: there are 16*20 = 320 fields. The first tile covers 12 cells,
leaving 308 fields empty. Each next tile can overlap at most 4 cells (per the
rules) and thus covers at least 8 empty fields. 308 / 8 = 38.5, so at most 38
additional moves are possible. (Is this possible in practice?)


My current player is quite good at spoiling the opponent's squares, keeping
scores very low for both players.
